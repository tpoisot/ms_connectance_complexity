> Connectance and degree distributions are important components of the structure of ecological networks. In this contribution, we use a statistical argument and simple network generating models to show that properties of the degree distribution are driven by network connectance. We discuss the consequences of this finding for (1) the generation of random networks in null-model analyses, and (2) the interpretation of network structure and ecosystem properties in relationship with degree distribution.

# Introduction

Ecologists developed a strong interest for network theory, as it allowed to
make sense of some of the complexity of ecological communities. In contrast to
early approaches on "community modules" [groups of a few
species within a large community, @holt_community_1997] a network level approach allows
one to account for the whole community scale [@dunne_network_2006], thus integrating
all direct and indirect interactions [@berlow_simple_2009]. Networks have
often been called "complex" [@williams_simple_2000], on account of the fact
that they represent objects (ecological communities) with complex dynamics (i.-e. non-linear,
sensitive to indirect interactions). Because networks are
multi-faceted objects with a rich range of structure, ecologists have been
looking for emerging properties that can be easily measured and analyzed, and
that relate to ecological properties and processes.

Early in the ecological network literature, connectance, *i.e.* the proportion of realized ecological interactions among the potential ones (most often the squared species richness), has been recognized as a central network property
[@yodzis_connectance_1980;@martinez_constant_1992]. 
% DG: I think the original interest derives from May's work on stability
In part, this success can
be attributed to the relationship between connectance and early definitions of
network complexity [@pimm_food_1982], and to the fact that connectance predicts
reasonably well key dynamical properties of ecological networks
[@dunne_food-web_2002;@dunne_network_2002] including their stability
[@may_will_1972]. More recently, attention shifted from connectance, a community-averaged property, tothe degree
distribution, that is the statistical properties of the distribution of number
of interactions per species. Variation of degree distribution among networks
has often been taken as evidence that assembly or interaction mechanisms differ
[@williams_biology_2011;@vazquez_degree_2005], and increasingly refined methods
to estimate degree distribution have been devised [@williams_simple_2009]. Some
authors proposed that degree distribution, rather than connectance, is driving
higher level network properties such as nestedness or modularity, which are important drivers of network
dynamics [@fortuna_nestedness_2010].

However, it is worth asking if we were not too quick in discarding connectance
in profit of degree distribution. A network, ecological or otherwise, can be
viewed as a physical space that edges (interactions) occupy. The size of this
space is limited by the number of nodes. This means that there are physical
constraints on the filling of a network, due to the fact that placing the first
edge will limit the number of ways to place the remaining edges, and so on. For
example, there is only one way to have a fully connected network, and there are
a limited number of ways to have a network with the lowest possible connectance.
For this reason, and given the rising importance of degree distribution in the literature, it is
important that we clearly understand how constrained this distribution actually
is in relation to connectance. In this contribution, using an argument from
combinatorial statistics and simulations of pseudo-random networks under two
different models, we present strong evidence that degree distribution, along
with other emerging network properties, are constrained (and can be predicted to a certain extent) by
connectance. We discuss the consequences of our results for the comparison of
different ecological networks, and for the generation of random networks in
null-model analyses.

# Statistical argument

Assuming an ecological network made of $n$ species, and assuming undirected
interactions with no self-edges (*e.g.* no cannibalism), there can be at most
$M = n(n-1)/2$ interactions
% DG: directed interactions? otherwise why dividing by 2?
 in this network, in which case it is a complete
graph (the results presented below hold qualitatively for both directed graphs,
and graphs in which self-edges are allowed). We note this maximal number of
links $M_n$. With this
information in hand, it is possible to know the total number of possible
networks given a number $l$ of interactions.

If we term $S_n$ the set of all possible $M_n$ edges in a $n$-node network, then
the number $G_{n,l}$ of possible networks with $l$ links is the number of
$l$-combinations of $S_n$, meaning that $G_{n,l} = C_l^{M_n}$, (where $C_x^y$ is
the binomial coefficient, *i.e.* the number of possible ways to pick $x$
elements among $y$) or
% DG: I'm confused here. C is connectance? Say it explicitly
% DG: what is y? 

$$G_{n,l} = \frac{M_n!}{l!(M_n-l)!}$$

Note that this number of possible networks include some graphs in which nodes
have a degree of 0, and that in most ecological studies, such nodes will be
discarded. We therefore have to evaluate how many of such networks will be found withing $G_{n,l}$. In addition, in a null-model context
[@bascompte_nested_2003;@fortuna_habitat_2006], having unconnected nodes in
random replicates will change the richness of the community, thus possibly
biasing the value of randomized emerging properties.
% DG: We don't have enough information to understand the previous sentence.
 Finding out the number of
networks 
$ DG: I changed the word to network. Be careful to use a constant terminology
in which a given node have a degree of 0 is similar to finding out how many
networks exist with $l$ links between the $n-1$ nodes. If one node is removed from
the network, there are $C_{n-1}^n$ possible combinations of nodes (this
simplifies to $n$).
%DG: I don't get the simplification
 For each of these, there are $G_{n-1,l}$ possible
networks configurations. Note that these networks will also include situations
in which *more* than one species has a degree of 0, so that evaluating
$G_{n-2,l}$ and so forth is not necessary. 
% DG: again, I don't catch which this evaluation is not necessary. I guess it is because you are looking at how many networks will have at least one node with degree 0, which includes all networks with more than one node with degree 0. Reword
Calling $R_{n,l}$ the number of
networks with $n$ nodes and $l$ edges in which all nodes have at least one edge
attached, we can write

$$R_{n,l} = G_{n,l} - C_{n-1}^n	\times G_{n-1,l}  $$

% DG: I took Amael's approach and found there might be something wrong with this eqation. I think it has to do with the definition of C, and it might simply miss a division by n at some point. R, C and G are numbers of networks. So C*G (the right term) should yield a square number of networks. 

We call the quantities $R$ and $G$, respectively, the *realized* and *total*
network space. They measure how many networks of $n$ nodes and $l$ edges
exists, either allowing or preventing the existence of nodes with no
interactions. Based on this reasonning, we can make two predictions.

**Prediction 1:** Because $C_x^y = C_{y-x}^y$, it comes that the total network
space is largest when $l = M_n/2$. As in this context the maximal number of
edges is $M_n$, we define effective connectance as $Co = l/M_n$, so $\mathrm{max}(G_{n,l})$ is
reached at $Co = 1/2$. The algebraic expression of the maximum value of
$R_{n,l}$ is hard to find, but simulations show that it also occurs around $Co=
1/2$. In other words, regardless of the number of nodes in a network, the
"degrees of freedom" of network structure, as indicated by the size of the
realized and total network spaces, is maximized at intermediate connectance.

**Prediction 2:** $R_{n,l}$ will become asymptotically closer to $G_{n,l}$ when
$l$ is close to $M_n$. In other words, there is only one way to fill a network
of $n$ nodes with $M_n$ interactions, and in this situation there is no
possibility to have nodes with a degree of 0. In the situation in which $l
= M_n$, $G_{n,l} = C_{M_n}^{M_n} = 1$, given that $M_n > M_{n-1}$, it comes that
$G_{n,l} = R_{n,l} = 1$.

%DG: If you keep the same structure, it would be important to give an ecological interpretation of prediction #2

We now illustrate these predictions using networks of 10 nodes, with a number of
edges varying from 10 to $M_{10}$ (*i.e.* 45 edges). As illustrated in Fig.
\ref{anaspace}, the size of the network space has a hump-shaped relationship
with connectance, and the size of the realized network space becomes closer to
the size of the total network space when connectance increases.

[anaspace]: ana_space.png "Image Title"
![Size of the total and realized network space for $n = 10$. As predicted in the main text, (1) the size of network spaces peaks at $Co = 1/2$, and (2) the size of the realized network space becomes asymptotically closer to the size of the total network space when connectance increases. \label{anaspace}][anaspace]

In Fig. \ref{anaratio}, we show that regardless of the network size, the
relative size of the realized network space increases with connectance. The
rate at which it occurs increases with network size.
However, in all cases, when connectance is low, there are only a very small
proportion of the total network space in which all nodes have at least one edge. This
suggest that the structure of extremely sparse networks is also strongly
constrained. This is congruent with historical findings by @erdos_random_1959,
namely that the probability of each node being connected to the graph giant
component increases with average degree (thus for high connectances, all
nodes are likely to be connected to the giant component, hence no node
has a degree of 0). In the context of ecology, in which most networks
have a low connectance, it implies that generating random networks to test null hypotheses can be
a computationally intensive task, as the realized network space is
(proportionally) small.

# Simulations

In the previous part, we show mathematically that connectance (the number of
realized *vs.* possible interactions), relative to the network size,
determines the size of the *network space*, *i.e.* how many possible network
combinations exist. Based on this, we can therefore expect that the degree
distribution will be contingent upon network connectance. Specifically, we
expect that the variance of the degree distribution, which is often related
to ecosystem properties and other network structures
[@fortuna_nestedness_2010], will display a hump-shaped relationship with
connectance. The mean, kurtosis, and skewness of the degree distribution
should all vary in a monotonous way with connectance.

In the simulations below, we use networks of 30 nodes, filled with 35 to
$M_{30}$ interactions. We use two different routines to generate random networks, that
are contrasted in the way they distribute edges among nodes. First, we generate
Erdős-Rényi (ER) graphs, meaning that every potential interaction has the same
probability of being realized [@erdos_random_1959]. We use an algorithm
inspired by @knuth_volume_1997, allowing to fix the number of edges in the
graph rather than the probability of an edge occurring, although the generated
graphs have the same properties as the original ER model. A total of 19000
networks are generated this way. Second, we use the niche model of food webs
[@williams_simple_2000], which generates networks under rules representing
hypothesized mechanisms of prey-selection in empirical ecosystems [@gravel_inferring_2013]. This
particular model assumes that the existence of interactions is constrained by
the position of species along a "niche" axis, for example body size. Other
randomization methods for food webs exists, but given that
@stouffer_quantitative_2005 showed that they yield similar degree distributions
to the niche model, we will not use them here. A total of 500 replicates for
each value of $l$ are generated. All networks generated with the
two models are free of self-edges and nodes with a null degree.

For each replicate, we measure the degree distribution and report its
variance, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, and skewness. In addition, for
each network, we fit a power-law distribution on the sorted degree distribution
using the least-squares method; we report the power-law exponent.

[simstat]: sim_stats.png "title"
![Statistical descriptors of the degree distribution of randomized networks, $n=30$, increasing connectance. These results show that central properties of the degree distribution are contingent upon connectance, at a given network size, and under a given network generation model. ER networks are in blue, niche-model networks are in red.\label{simstat}][simstat]

Qualitatively, the random graphs and the niche networks behave exactly the
same. With the exception of the kurtosis, *all* statistical descriptors of the
degree distribution were influenced by the effective connectance (Fig.
\ref{simstat}). As predicted in the previous part, variance of the degree
distribution is hump-shaped with regard to connectance, which implies that as
average degree increases with connectance, the coefficient of variation of the
degree distribution decreases at high connectances. Note also that the range of
variances in the degree distribution is higher at intermediate connectances, but
lower at the extreme. Due to the fact that the Erdős-Rényi graphs we simulate
are essentially Poisson random graphs, it is expected that the variance of their
degree distribution would be lower than for the niche model, which in contrast
*forces* strong difference in the degree of species according to their niche
position.

Kurtosis is independent of connectance, while skewness decreases
with connectance. This result is expected. Positively skewed
distribution have longer or fatter right tails, indicating mostly low values
(low degree): unconnected networks are made mostly of species with a weak
generality [@schoener_food_1989]. On the other hand, negative
skewness indicate that most of the values in the distribution are high.
Ecologically, it means that most species are wide-range generalists, which
happens in densely connected networks. This bears important ecological
consequences, as it indicates that due to physical constraints acting on the
filling of interactions within the graphs, networks with intermediate connectances are expected to have species with both low and high generality [@schoener_food_1989].

[powerlaw]: sim_power.png "title"
![The estimate of the power-law exponent increases with connectance, reaching a flat distribution for complete graphs. \label{powerlaw}][powerlaw] 
%DG: technically, I think we should not even try to fit a power law to highly connected networks. It needs to be truncated as soon at the probability of a species having a degree of 2*n is non negligible. I would therefore avoid the highest values and the second part of the legend on complete graphs

The estimate of the power-law exponent increases when connectance increases
(Fig. \ref{powerlaw}). This indicates that the degree distribution flattens when
connectance increases. Taken with the elements presented above, we show that all
of the estimators of the degree distribution vary strongly with connectance of
the network.

# Practical consequences

Randomized null models are often used to estimate how much a given network
property deviates from its random expectation [@flores_statistical_2011]. Our
results show two things. First, except for extremely high or low connectance,
the proportion of the network space that will be explored using $10^3$
or $10^4$ replicates (typical values in null models analyses) is orders
of magnitude smaller than the *realized* network space. Although this
is somewhat compensated by the fact that a part of these networks are
isomorphic, the risk of inferring deviation from the random expectation
based on a drastically small sampling of the network space is real, and
unaddressed. On the other hand, when connectance is high, the number of
unique network combinations decreases, and there is a risk to
pseudo-replicate some of them when generating random networks. 
% DG: I would not use the term pseudo-replication since it has to do with degrees of freedom in frequentists statistics. It is meaningless (I mean, almost) for randomized hypothesis testing. I think it would be more appropriate and precise to refer to type I and type II errors
To the
best of our knowledge, these issues have seldom be addressed in the
literature on ecological network randomization.

Second, generating null models with a low connectance is a computationally
intensive task. When connectance decreases, the *realized* network space
decreases faster than the *total* network space, meaning that the probability of
picking a network with no 0 degree nodes (which is simply $R_{n,l}/G_{n,l}$)
goes toward zero. For this reason, classical rejection sampling (accept the
random network if no nodes have no edges, reject it if not) is bound to take an
unreasonable amount of time in networks with low connectance. 
% DG: It will also select some types of networks. Obviously, the average degree and the skewness of the distribution of networks with no 0 degree nodes will be different (spreading of the edges among a larger number of nodes)
For this
reason, using a purely random matrix shuffling as a starting point, then
swapping interactions until no free nodes remain, seems to be a promising way
to address this problem.
%DG: you have a reference for this?

# Conclusions

Connectance is an extremely intuitive property of network, expressing how much
of the potential interactions are realized. Through statistical reasoning and
simple simulations using models of random networks, we show that for a given
number of species, connectance drives (i) how many different networks exist,
and (ii) some key elements of the degree distribution. We observed both
among and between model quantitative changes in degree distribution
along a connectance gradient. The niche model is a particularly striking
example of this, with the variance in the degree distribution increasing
50-fold when connectance moves from 0.1 to 0.5. This result has
 practical implications for network comparisons. As descriptors of degree distribution vary with
connectance, connectance should be factored out from all analyses. 
% DG: might pose some colinearity problems though
To
some extent, the impact of connectance is lesser in the 0.05-0.3 range
where most empirical food webs lies (although bipartite networks can
have much higher connectances), but the effect is high enough that
it should not be ignored: at equal number of species, networks with
different connectances are expected to have different degree
distributions.

Finally, this analysis raises interesting ecological questions. Early analyses
focusing on degree distribution argued that ecological mechanisms were
responsible for the shape of the distribution
[@vazquez_degree_2005;@fortuna_nestedness_2010;@williams_biology_2011]. In this
contribution, we show that connectance will impose a lower and higher limit for
the shape of the degree distribution. Given this information, it is time to
bring the debate full-circle: is connectance the cause of observed network
properties, or an emergent property of pairwise species interactions? As the
later seems far more likely, it now makes sense to focus on why some networks
deviate, or not, from the expected degree distribution knowing their
connectance.
%DG: just a random thought: it would be interesting to put these results in the context of May's criterion of stability.
% DG: going one step further, I also wonder how much the shape of the motifs frequency distribution will be impacted by connectance. My feeling is that with increasing C the distribution will get flatter. Low connectance and selection will promote the emergence of some peaks.
